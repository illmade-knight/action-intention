# **action-intention: Migration Plan to Requirements-as-Code**

## **1\. Vision: A Language-Agnostic Foundation**

The goal of this migration is to elevate the action-intention project from a Go application into a formal, multi-platform specification. We will apply the established "Requirements-as-Code" methodology to create a single source of truth from which all future application code—the Go backend, a web frontend, and native mobile clients—can be generated and verified.

The core principle is to make the high-level requirements (**L1** and **L2**) completely language-agnostic, describing the system's purpose and architectural rules in pure, conceptual terms. The technical requirements (**L3**) will define the specific data models and API contracts in a structured, language-neutral format that can be easily translated into any target language.

## **2\. The Migration Process**

The migration will follow a structured, three-step process:

### **Step 1: Formalize Requirements (This Document)**

We will distill all existing knowledge from the project outlines and our refactoring work into a complete, layered set of L1, L2, and L3 requirements documents. This formalizes the "what," "how," and "specifics" of the application in a way that is clear, traceable, and ready for prompt engineering.

### **Step 2: Develop the Prompt Suite**

Once the requirements are finalized, we will create a new, version-controlled suite of prompts. This suite will be structured to support multi-language generation:

* **prompts/meta/**: Will contain language-agnostic preprompts and context for the overall system.
* **prompts/go/**: Will contain prompts specifically for generating the Go backend components (storage adapters, clients, etc.).
* **prompts/typescript/**: (Future) Will contain prompts for generating TypeScript data models and API client code for a web frontend.
* **prompts/swift/**: (Future) Will contain prompts for an iOS client.

### **Step 3: Regenerate & Verify**

Using the new prompt suite, we will regenerate the Go backend code piece by piece, following the established "Red \-\> Green \-\> Refine" TDD workflow. This will bring the existing Go codebase into full alignment with the new, formal requirements and create a repeatable process for all future development.
